Once the Vara script has successfully completed the install process, you need to edit a com port to bind to your rig control device.

In a terminal type the following:

ls /dev/tty* to identify the port for your usb rig control device.

Next you need to create a COM port that the windows program can understand:

In a terminal type:

wine regedit

A regedit window will open. From there you need to navigate through:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wine\Ports

Right click in the open field and select New String Value
Edit the name to 'COM#' # = the number you decide to use
Edit the date value of the new port to point to the linux port ie. /dev/ttyUSB0

Once done, you can close out of the window and start your programs.
